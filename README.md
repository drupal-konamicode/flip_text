Flip Text jQuery Plugin for the Drupal Konami Code module
=========

jQuery plugin to flip text around. E.g: "Drupal is awesome" will become "ǝɯosǝʍɐ sᴉ lɐdnɹp" but this for the whole webpage you're currently visiting.

The original idea came from YouTube and was jQueryfied by [Paul Irish](https://www.paulirish.com/2009/flip-text-upside-down-jquery-plugin/) published under "Creative Commons CC0". Therefore we were allowed to alter the original source, make it up to date with jQuery deprications and Drupalify it.

Installation

> composer require drupal-konamicode/flip_text
